It has now became a gigantic, static source of big data that can be queried (for now) but personal interactions are no more. It is also increasingly hard to trace the source of any given &ldquo;information&rdquo; and validate its origins. Trust us bro, our data is legit and our insights are real.</p><p>Personal blogs are there to drive traffic for ads. Social media is there to mine data and to sell ads. <em>So did capitalism kill the internet?</em> We do have an innate desire to use every scheme at our disposal to gain revenue.</p><p><em>Did bots and large neural nets kill the net?</em> Well they are certainly trying to make enought noise to suffocate any sense of human generated interactions. We are also living in a post Turing test era so it will be harder and harder to validate of the origin of any given medium including texts, images, videos and audio.</p><p><em>Did big tech kill the internet?</em> Search engines reduce direct interactions but they also provide a way to find stuff you would not come across otherwise. It is also a great way to sell ads and high search rankings. Buying up smaller competition doesn&rsquo;t help either as you end up with these centralized portals which you have to interact with in order to gain any information.</p><p><strong>The internet is still there</strong>, our servers are running and hosting content and people are consuming their contents - it&rsquo;s just the way we interact with it and what we use it for is what changed. We are social creatures but when we want digital interactions we just visit one of the social media sites and hit up our friends personally. Anonym personal interactions are dying out in my opinion and what is changing is how we gather data and consume information.</p><p>Maybe all we need is to go AFK and to put more value into actual personal interactions and experiences. We also need to learn how to not take the flow of free and valid information as a given and to do our own critical thinking when we consume any information. This might make us better thinkers on the long term but if we get lazy our degree of freedom will probably drastically decrease in the coming decades. Tech is just a tool, it&rsquo;s up to us what we will make of it.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-dark-gray bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://zedsoft.hu/>&copy; ZedSoft Blog 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
