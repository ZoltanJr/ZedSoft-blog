I would like to store the code and posts in GitHub and I would like to deploy it with a GitActions CI on every push to the main branch. I would like to utilize Markup so my posts can be formatted. Hosting should be simple to set up and cheap. I already own a domain/url. Please generate the base project and necessary setup steps&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote><p>If you&rsquo;ve read a few posts about prompt engineering you already know this is horrible and could be improved in various ways to sound more like a set of specific instructions. But that is no issue for the hero of our story, GPT-4 for a simple task like this.</p><h3 id=response>Response:</h3><blockquote><p>To create a simple self-deployed blog with Flask and Node.js, you can use a static site generator like Hugo. Hugo can convert your Markdown content into HTML and deploy it using GitHub Pages, which is free and simple to set up. You can use GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a step-by-step guide to create and deploy your blog:</p><h4 id=install-hugo>Install Hugo.</h4><p>On macOS, you can use Homebrew to install Hugo:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>brew install hugo
</code></pre><p>On Windows, you can use Chocolatey:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>choco install hugo -confirm
</code></pre><p>For other platforms, check the official documentation.</p><h4 id=create-a-new-hugo-site>Create a new Hugo site:</h4><pre tabindex=0><code>hugo new site my-blog

</code></pre><p>Visit http://localhost:1313/ to see your blog.</p><h4 id=set-up-github-pages>Set up GitHub Pages.</h4><p>Create a new GitHub repository, and push your blog&rsquo;s code to the main branch.</p><p>In your GitHub repository, go to Settings > Pages, and select the gh-pages branch as the source branch. Save the changes.</p><h4 id=set-up-github-actions>Set up GitHub Actions.</h4><p>Create a .github/workflows/deploy.yml file in your blog&rsquo;s repository with the following content:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>name: Deploy

Save the changes.</p><p>Create a CNAME file in the static directory of your blog&rsquo;s repository with your custom domain:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>echo &#39;your-custom-domain.com&#39; &gt; static/CNAME
</code></pre><p>Commit and push the changes.</p><h4 id=configure-your-domain-provider>Configure your domain provider.</h4><p>Go to your domain provider&rsquo;s settings, and add a CNAME record pointing your custom domain to <em>your-github-username</em>.github.io.</p><p>Now your blog is set up and will be automatically deployed to your custom domain every time you push to the main branch.</p></blockquote><p>I am quite impressed so far with what it can do and in my personal opinion the hype is real - generative AI is a game changer for how we will work and search in the future. Humans using AI to create stuff which another AI will process and redistribute to humans. The wild west of mostly unregulated AI is upon us.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://example.org/>&copy; ZedSoft Blog 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
