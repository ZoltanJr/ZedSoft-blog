Valuable information is hard to come by compared to the amount of data we have access to. Generative AI will provide even more noise to the ever growing orchestra of the global internet. How can one combat this seemingly unavoidable wave of events that are leading up to a larger-than-ever haystack of data?

One can certainly make a business riding these waves. New human written, high quality, cross validated and well labelled datasets which contain specialized information will be hard to come by and they will be essential for improving pre-trained models for specific use cases. This seems like the ideal setup for a new wave of publishing enterprises. Acquire ownership of IPs with higher payments that a traditional publisher could afford as the revenue is not only dependent on human consumers of said intellectual property.

Use filters to protect against AI generated content and control quality with a reputable review board that also provides credibility and you got yourself a business. Probably it's better to focus on digital content to reduce the logistics overhead and costs.

While this looks, sounds and tastes like a pure capitalist business model that is not the entire truth. New-gen publishers could create financial incentive for creative minds to generate high value content that could improve the signal // noise ratio in our needle-in-a-haystack situation and these content can be made available significantly cheaper or even for free then a classic publishing business could afford as that is not the main stream of income. In return, the AI models trained on these sets of data could yield better results and would bring more value to their specific business fields improving the pace of innovation.

I would also add a hypothetical and probably overly hopeful layer of a well crafted system of regulations for AI generated content. Simply label everything generated with AI as such and make it less commercially attractive. Applying a less strict policy of IP laws to AI generated content would also make it less of a value. Run regular checks for AI generated content and hand out a few big fines to set an example. Carrots and sticks needs to co-exist to keep at least some resemblance to order as we are sailing to brand new seas.

Take all of this with a huge grain of salt. These posts are just my ramblings. Make up your own opinions and keep investing energy into finding your needle in the ever growing dataset that is being forcefully pushed into our brains through every imaginable way or you will get tangled up within someone elses truth.
