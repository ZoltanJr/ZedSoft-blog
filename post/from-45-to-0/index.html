It was the right thing to do but still a bittersweet moment. I failed. But that already happened by the time I founded the company, it was just a long death-spiral afterwards for me.</p><p>In early 2022 I&rsquo;ve received a quite large project and I convinced my co-founders to launch a company so we can build on that cash and create our own products, create a sandbox environment for upcoming talent and build a great engineering organization. The problem is that you cannot be everything, everywhere, all at once. You have to focus. There is also the issue of money - If you bring in all the cash you start to be sceptic and bitter about how it is spent and where it lands. It takes time and resources to build something that lasts and I fundementally lacked patience. Maybe I still do. I also lacked trust and became quite difficult to work with. I felt like we cannot agree on anything and even if we do everyone will go ahead and do their own stuff anyway.</p><p>Having my own company was a dream of mine since a very young age - Initially I wanted to design cars, then I became interested in creating a music recording and production studio however my most valuable skill became software engineering. I had quite a few unlanched startup ideas and I entered a competition which I won but that was too ambitious and risky for the investors so it ended up going nowhere. So after spending some time in a digital consultancy it seemed like the perfect time to finally do my own thing. I had some cash on hand, had the experience, had a seemingly good plan and I had a client willing to pay for my services. Where did it go wrong?</p><p>I was impatient, I focused too much on the money and I chose the wrong CEO. Not because he was bad, but deep down I wanted to lead and I was unwilling to follow. I had a clear vision in mind which on paper we all agreed with but in reality these pictures differed quite dramatically. In the end I would not put the blame on anyone but myself.</p><p>There are quite a few lessons there that shall not be forgotten.</p><ul><li>FOCUS. Your time is limited. Your resources are basically non existent. 1 thing at a time.</li><li>PATIENCE. Things take time so commit to the process. Constant re-planning sessions do not help either.</li><li>TRUST. If you do not trust your co-founders something is fundementally wrong. Fix it or leave.</li><li>CLARITY. Be in constant sync. The ship needs to go in a certain direction or it will flip.</li></ul><p>Now is the time to reflect, learn and move on. I think I needed this experience to be a more well rounded human being and I wish all the best for my co-founders. I am happy with the current challenges I face so onwards and upwards. I guess the last lesson is that whatever happens always move forward. Do not get stuck in the past.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-dark-gray bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://zedsoft.hu/>&copy; ZedSoft Blog 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
