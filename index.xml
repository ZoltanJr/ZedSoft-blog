It was the right thing to do but still a bittersweet moment. I failed. But that already happened by the time I founded the company, it was just a long death-spiral afterwards for me.
In early 2022 I&amp;rsquo;ve received a quite large project and I convinced my co-founders to launch a company so we can build on that cash and create our own products, create a sandbox environment for upcoming talent and build a great engineering organization.</description></item><item><title>Who Killed the Internet</title><link>http://zedsoft.hu/post/who-killed-the-internet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 13:57:48 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://zedsoft.hu/post/who-killed-the-internet/</guid><description>The internet feels dead. It has now become a gigantic, static source of big data that can be queried (for now) but personal interactions are no more. It is also increasingly hard to trace the source of any given &amp;ldquo;information&amp;rdquo; and validate its origins. Trust us bro, our data is legit and our insights are real.
Personal blogs are there to drive traffic for ads. Social media is there to mine data and to sell ads.</description></item><item><title>Needle in a Haystack</title><link>http://zedsoft.hu/post/needle-in-a-haystack/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2023 01:16:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://zedsoft.hu/post/needle-in-a-haystack/</guid><description>Valuable information is hard to come by compared to the amount of data we have access to. Generative AI will provide even more noise to the ever growing orchestra of the global internet. How can one combat this seemingly unavoidable wave of events that are leading up to a larger-than-ever haystack of data?
One can certainly make a business riding these waves. New human written, high quality, cross validated and well labelled datasets which contain specialized information will be hard to come by and they will be essential for improving pre-trained models for specific use cases.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>http://zedsoft.hu/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://zedsoft.hu/about/</guid><description>This blog is about Zoltan V&amp;rsquo;s thoughts on software engineering and other things</description></item></channel></rss>
